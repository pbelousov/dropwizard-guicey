 * specify proper binding itself.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #bind(Binder, Class, boolean)} called for extensions not manually bound in guice</li>
 * <li>{@link #manualBinding(Binder, Class, Binding)} called for extensions, resolved from manual guice binding</li>
 * <li>{@link #extensionBound(Stage, Class)} (Binder, Class)} is always called after one of install methods above in
 * order to apply actions common for both registration types (usually reporting).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Install methods may be also used to restrict extension declaration only as class or bindings.
 * <p>
 * If extension is annotated with {@code LazyBinding} boolean hint is passed and installer must decide
 * what to do with it (preferably support or fail, not ignore). Bindings extensions (resolved from guice modules)
 * may not be declared as lazy (this will be detected automatically).
 * <p>
 * Installer may be called multiple times if guice bindings or aop report is enabled. If required, report execution
 * may be detected by used stage: {@code binder.currentStage() == Stage.TOOL}.
