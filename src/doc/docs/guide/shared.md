# Shared configuration state

Sometimes, it is required to pass configuration values between different application parts
or implement bundles communication. In these cases usually you have to use `ThreadLocal` (direct static fields can't 
be used because it will make problems for tests).

!!! attention
    Use it only when it's not possible to avoid.

Guicey adds shared state support in order to replace all current and future hacks (and 
so avoid unexpected side effects for tests).

Shared state is created together with `GuiceBundle` creation and destroyed with application shutdown.
Internally it is implemented as static map with value reference by application instance.

!!! note
    Shared state content is intentionally not logged (there is no report for that) because
    it is an internal state. Don't abuse it! It must be used only for edge cases.
    
Guicey use it for storing `Injector` object lookup ([InjectorLookup](guice/injector.md#access-injector) is actually a shortcut).
Also, all main dropwizard objects are stored there for direct reference.

[SPA](../extras/spa.md) and [GSP](../extras/gsp.md) bundles use it for bundles communication.    

## Utility

During startup shared state could be obtained with a static call:

```java
SharedConfigurationState.getStartupInstance() 
```

!!! note ""
    Static reference is possible only from the main application thread (which is always the case during initialization)

Shared state holds references to the main dropwizard objects, see methods:

- getBootstrap()
- getApplication()
- getEnvironment()
- getConfiguration()
- getConfigurationTree()

All of them return providers: e.g. `SharedConfigurationState.getStartupInstance().getBootsrap()`
would return `Provider<Bootstrap>`. This is required because target object
might not be available yet, still there would be a way to initialize some logic with "lazy object"
(to call it later, when object would be available) at any configuration stage.

## Shared state restrictions

Internally shared state is a `Map<Class, Object>`. Class is used as key because assumed 
usage scope is bundle and it will force you to use bundle class as a key (or any holder object class). Moreover, non string
key reduce dummy typos (internally, values are stored by string class name to unify keys from different class loaders). 

Other restrictions:

* State value can be **set just once**! This is simply to avoid hard to track problems with overridden state.
* State value can't be null! Again, to avoid problems with NPE errors.

It is assumed that state will be used not for simple values, but for shared configuration objects.
But there is no direct restrictions.

## Main bundle

It is assumed that there should be no need to access shared state from [main bundle](configuration.md#main-bundle).
So [the only state-related method](configuration.md#hooks-related) actually assumed to be used by [hooks](hooks.md):
 
```java
static class XHook implements GuiceyConfigurationHook {
    @Override
    void configure(GuiceBundle.Builder builder) {
        builder.withSharedState(state -> {
            state.put(XHook, new SharedObject());
        });
    }
}
```  

## Guicey bundle

Shared state is assumed to be used by bundles. Bundle provides special [shortcut methods](configuration.md#guicey-bundle) 
for accessing state. It is assumed that state is declared under initialization phase and
could be accessed under both phases (but not restricted, so state could be declared in run phase too).

For usage examples see [decomposition section](../decomposition.md#shared-state).

## Guice modules

Shared state is not intended to be used in guice modules, but it is possible. 
To simplify usage there are shortcuts available in [dropwizard aware module](guice/module-autowiring.md#shared-state) base class. 

## Static access

If required, shared state could be accessed statically everywhere:

```java
SharedConfigurationState.get(application)
```

!!! note ""
    Direct static access (`SharedConfigurationState.getStartupInstance()`) is available only during startup, at runtime you can reference state
    only with Environment or Application objects.

Or direct value access:

```java
SharedConfigurationState.lookup(application, XBundle.class)
```                    

And it is possible to use `Environment` instance for access:

```java
SharedConfigurationState.get(environment)
SharedConfigurationState.lookup(environment, XBundle.class)
```

Special shorcut methods may be used for "get or fail behaviour":

```java
SharedConfigurationState.lookupOrFail(app, XBundle.class, 
        "Failed to lookup %s service", XBundle.class.getSimpleName())
``` 

It will throw IllegalStateException if shared context is not available or no value.
Note that message is formatted with `String.format`. 

## Tests

Shared state is referenced by application instance, so there should not be any
problems with tests.

The only possible side effect is when you test many application startup error situations, 
when application did not shutdown properly and so some shared contexts may not be removed.
If it (hard to imagine how) will affect your tests, you can forcefully clean all states:

```java
SharedConfigurationState.clear()
```                         

## Default objects

The following objects are available in shared state just in case:

* Bootstrap
* Environment
* Configuration
* [ConfigurationTree](yaml-values.md)

So any of it could be accessed statically with application or environment instance:

```java
Optional<Bootstrap> bootstrap = SharedConfigurationState
            .lookup(environment, Bootstrap.class);
```                

or

```java
Bootstrap bootstrap = SharedConfigurationState
            .lookupOrFail(environment, Bootstrap.class, "No bootstrap available");
``` 

!!! tip
    During startup these objects might be referenced as lazy objects with [shortcuts](#utility)
